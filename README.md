Fishing Game - Suggestions are welcome!

- I have a lot of ideas in mind, expect many updates.
- Mini to-do list:
    Locations: Freshwater (already), Saltwater
    More bait selections
    More mechanics regarding reeling, casting, and waiting for bites.
    More fish to add
    Improving UI visually, adding more effects and art.
    Maybe some sounds (Casting, Setting hook, reeling)
