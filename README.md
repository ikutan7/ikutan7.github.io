*Fishing Game*

-----------------

I have a lot of ideas in mind, expect many updates.
 # To-do list:
  - Locations: Freshwater (already), Saltwater
  - More bait selections
  - More mechanics regarding reeling, casting, and waiting for bites.
  - More fish to add
  - Improving UI visually, adding more effects and art.
  - Maybe some sounds (Casting, Setting hook, reeling)
